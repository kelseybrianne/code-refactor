# Code Refactor

To improve the accessibility of the page, I changed most of the <div> tags and replaced them with semantic HTML tags, such as <header>, <nav>, <section>, <main>, <aside>, and <footer>. I also added and alt and title attribute to all of the image files that were linked in the HTML file, added a descriptive title to the <head> of the page and added appropriate id's so that the links would work properly in the navigation bar.

The CSS needed to be improved by consolidating some of the selectors so that there was no unnecessary repetition throughout the file. This required that I change some of the class names associated with different HTML elements. I also rearranged the order of the CSS selectors so that it would match the order of the elements as they appeared in the HTML file.
