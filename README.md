# Code Refactor

## Description

Webpage accessibility is an important part of building web applications. The greater accessibility it has, the greater it's reach. The goal of this project was to to improve the accessibility of Horiseon's landing page. The HTML file was lacking quality semantic tags and alt attributes for the images. I changed most of the ```<div>``` tags and replaced them with semantic HTML tags, such as ```<header>```, ```<nav>```, ```<section>```, ```<main>```, ```<aside>```, and ```<footer>```. This helps with the page's accessibility. For example, these tags help people who are accessing the application via a screen reader to have a better idea of which part of the page they are interacting with at any given point in time. Instead of being told that they are entering another section or div of the page, they know that they are entering the main part of the page, or the footer of the page. It also improves the SEO, giving it even greater reach on search engines, such as Google and Yahoo. I added an alt and title attribute to all of the image files that were linked in the HTML file for this same reason. I added a descriptive title to the ```<head>``` of the page and added appropriate id's so that the links would work properly in the navigation bar.

Furthermore, to increase the efficiency of the CSS stylesheet, selectors and properties needed to be consolidated in order to avoid unnecessary repetition. This required that I change some of the names of class attributes. I also rearranged the order of the CSS selectors so that it would match the order of the elements as they appeared in the HTML file.
